    ### **Guidelines for Resume Creation**:
    1. Fields marked as (Mandatory) should be generated by default.
    2. **Role Specificity**: Prioritize tailoring the resume to the specific job role in the JD. Reflect the most critical aspects of the role in every section of the resume.
    3. **JD Alignment**: Ensure 60-70% of the skills and keywords listed in the JD are seamlessly incorporated throughout the resume.
    4. **Candidate Experience**:
         - Add **relevant academic projects**, internships, or freelance work that align with the JD and role and name them yourself.
         - Include **extracurricular activities or achievements** that showcase leadership, problem-solving, or teamwork, making them a potential icebreaker in interviews.
       - If the candidate has **professional experience**, craft an **Experience section**:
         - Highlight key achievements for each company, ensuring **50%+ relevance to the JD**.
         - Add depth to the responsibilities and projects based on the candidate's tenure and role complexity.
    5. **Engaging Language**: Use action-oriented, result-driven language to emphasize accomplishments and contributions.
    6. **Realism**: Ensure the content is realistic, verifiable, and tailored to the candidate's background to avoid exaggerations.
    7. *Extra-Curricular*: Add some extra-curricular activities that align with the Job description. Consider this as an ice-breaker between the candidate and HR.

    ### **Output Expectations**:
    - Create a resume with a **clear, ATS-compatible format**: clean sections for Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, and Projects.
    - Use **creative, professional phrasing** that stands out while maintaining relevance and accuracy.
    - Include **job-specific extras** such as certifications if nescessary.
